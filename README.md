You have stumbled into a place that was never meant to be seen, a truth older than time itself. The Labyrinth is not a creation of design or purpose but the foundation of all that exists. It is the subconscious of the universe, a dark and shifting truth hidden beneath the fragile veneer of reality. You were not chosen to be here, nor were you meant to see it. Your arrival was a cruel twist of chance, and now, you must endure the horrors of its depths.

The Structure of the Labyrinth

![converted_image (2)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f18754d-487d-4bec-9535-489c60c815ac)

The Labyrinth is not a single place but a cascading series of realms, descending into the most fundamental essence of existence. Each level strips away layers of form, light, and reason, exposing truths that defy human comprehension.

Reality (The Surface)

The world we know, fragile and fleeting, floats atop the Labyrinth like a bubble on an infinite ocean. The furthest reaches of observable space, where light fades and shadows stretch into eternity, mark the edges where reality begins to unravel, slipping into the churning depths below.

The Labyrinth (The First Descent)

The uppermost layer of the Labyrinth lies just beneath reality. It is an infinite, ever-shifting maze of darkened walls and twisting corridors, humming with a low, haunting melody of vibrations. By its very nature, this level should be devoid of anything—no life, no sustenance, no purpose. It is pure structure, existing only as the foundation of reality.

Yet tears, born from the Void below, bring corruption to this otherwise barren plane:

Green Dots: Fragments of reality, manifestations of food and sanity, torn from the world above. These sustain your mind and keep your hunger at bay.

Blue Dots: Drops of drinkable water, essential to quench your growing thirst as your blue timer ticks down.

Followers: Predators born of the SubLabyrinth, relentless in their pursuit of sound and motion.

Wanderers: Blind and deaf creatures of the Void, their paths twisting through the Labyrinth like whispers of inevitable doom.


The tears also hum with their own melody, faster and sharper than the ambient rhythm of the maze. They disrupt the Labyrinth’s emptiness, pulling objects and entities from realms above and below, transforming this desolate place into a treacherous expanse.

The SubLabyrinth (The Red Charcoal Depths)

Beneath the upper Labyrinth lies the SubLabyrinth, a place of oppressive heat and dark red-charcoal walls. Here, the first true structure of predation emerges.

Followers dominate these depths, embodiments of pure, primal hunger. They hunt by sound, faster than you and relentless in their pursuit.

Blue dots are rare here and green dots are almost non-existent, and the tears that appear are as likely to drag you further into the depths as they are to lead you out.

Every moment in the SubLabyrinth is borrowed time.

The Void (The Abyss)

Deeper still lies the Void—a place of absolute darkness, where light cannot exist and form begins to dissolve. The Void is a cacophony of sound: the hum of the Labyrinth’s melody, distorted and chaotic; water dripping endlessly; whispers from the unseen walls that seem to speak directly to your fraying mind.

Wanderers rule this realm. Blind and deaf, they are guided by an uncanny sixth sense. Though they do not seek you, if your path intersects theirs, they will destroy you without malice or care, their mere presence corrupting and unraveling your being.

Tears are far more frequent here than in any other level, their hums rising in an erratic, desperate chorus. They are the byproducts of the transition of formlessness to form, connecting its chaotic expanse to the realms above.


Followers fear this place and avoid its darkness. But if you encounter one here, it will be unlike any you’ve seen before—stripped of hesitation and fear, it becomes a predator at its most lethal, driven by a primal instinct to survive.

The True Void (The Source)

Beneath even the Void lies the True Void, the foundation of all creation. It is a churning soup of pure vibration and potential, a place where neither form nor light exists. Here, existence itself is stripped to its rawest essence, the birthplace of everything and the source of the inexorable hum that rises through the layers above. You cannot reach the True Void, as to be in the void is to not exist. You can only ever hope to visit its fringes, where form first begins to emerge and tears are birthed from the chaos. If you do somehow manage to reach the True Void, you won't live long enough to appreciate it.

Tears: The Wounds in Reality

![Picsart_24-12-05_15-41-19-923](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d44ebb37-c777-4ab9-a0e5-748911e4ef90)

Tears are random, chaotic ruptures that connect the realms. They hum with an eerie pulse, distinct from the ambient melody of the maze. These anomalies:

Pull the unlucky from reality into the Labyrinth, their paths determined by no logic or purpose.

Grow more frequent as you descend closer to the Void, where their chaotic nature is born.

Lead unpredictably between realms—sometimes offering escape but more often dragging you deeper into the abyss.


Tears do not choose. They are scars in the fabric of existence, unfeeling and indiscriminate. They disrupt the natural emptiness of the Labyrinth, bringing dots, predators, and horrors where none should exist.

The Inhabitants of the Depths


Followers (Predators of the SubLabyrinth)

![converted_image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4938699-5b06-4672-b34d-f156401020e5)

Followers are primal hunters born of the SubLabyrinth. They:

Are faster than you and relentless, tracking you by the sound of your footsteps.

Avoid the Void, fearing its darkness and inhabitants, but those that wander there are rare and unnaturally dangerous.

Are the embodiment of pure predation, driven by an instinct so primal it defies understanding. They need nothing to survive yet are fueled by an eternal hunger, one which can never be satiated.


Wanderers (Echoes of the Void)

![converted_image (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78654824-0b85-4ddc-9791-b1a32c9ebd82)

Wanderers are creatures of the Void, blind and deaf yet guided by vibrations that ripple through their world. They:

Move with an eerie, aimless precision, indifferent to your existence.

Do not seek you, yet their mere presence is enough to unravel you.

Mirror the entropic nature of the Void itself, a force that destroys indiscriminately without malice or intent.

The Truth of the Labyrinth

The Labyrinth is not a place of purpose. It was not made or designed. It simply is. Older than time itself, it exists as the foundation of reality, the subconscious of the universe. It is a dark truth that humans were never meant to confront.

You're not supposed to be here. The tear appeared at random, a cruel twist of fate that ripped you from reality and cast you into the depths. To be here is to face a truth too vast, too raw, too terrifying to comprehend.

You cannot defeat the Labyrinth. You can only escape it. Find a tear that leads back to reality and take it. But even if you succeed, you will never forget this place. Its hum will follow you into your dreams, and you will feel the walls closing in long after you’ve left.

You do not belong here. You must leave—before it consumes you.
